The device use frequency detection circuits connected to GPIO12 and GPIO13 of the LM1 ESP8266 chip. At the moment you have to use a script to make it work with Tasmota. Script is not supported with precompiled binary (at least 6.6.0) so you have to compile your own fw. Personally recommended gitpod: 

[https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/benzino77/tasmocompiler](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/benzino77/tasmocompiler)

Please note that the script not working good with core 2.3.0! 
Below two scripts which do something like switchmode4 and switchmode1. The script for switchmode4 is created by @thxthx0 and modified by me for switchmode1


SwitchMode1

`
>D
sw1=0
sw2=0
cnt1=0
cnt2=0
timer1=0
timer2=0
pwr1=0
pwr2=0


>B
=>print ""WiFi 2-Gang Switch Script""


>F
; Counter1/2 and Relay1/2 configured in template
cnt1=pc[1]
cnt2=pc[2]

if chg[cnt1]>0
then
; counter1 has changed, switch is on
sw1=1
else
; no change switch is off
sw1=0
endif

if chg[cnt2]>0
then
; counter2 has changed, switch is on
sw2=1
else
; no change switch is off
sw2=0
endif

; 100 ms timer
timer1+=1
timer2+=1

if sw1==1
and timer1>2
and pwr1==0

then
=>Power1 1
pwr1=1
endif

if sw1==0
and timer1<=2
and pwr1==1

then
=>Power1 0
pwr1=0
endif

if sw1==0
then
timer1=0
endif

if sw2==1
and timer2>2
and pwr2==0
then
=>Power2 1
pwr2=1
endif

if sw2==0
and timer2<=2
and pwr2==1
then
=>Power2 0
pwr2=0
endif

if sw2==0
then
timer2=0
endif

SwitchMode4
